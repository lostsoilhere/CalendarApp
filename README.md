## Assumptions

1. Appointments are always 60 minutes long.
2. The system doesn't handle timezone differences. All times are assumed to be in the same timezone.
3. There's no authentication system in place. In a real-world scenario, we would implement proper authentication and authorization.
4. We are only using in memory data structures with no persistance.
5. The input and output will be driven from standard IO.
