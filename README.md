## Assumptions

1. Appointments are always 60 minutes long.
2. The system doesn't handle timezone differences. All times are assumed to be in the same timezone.
3. There's no authentication system in place. In a real-world scenario, we would implement proper authentication and authorization.
4. We are only using in memory data structures with no persistence.
5. The input and output will be driven from standard IO.
6. The availability start and end time is same for all days.

<!---
1. Add the driver code(biggest work yet). 
2. Test the end to end flow. 
3. Add unit test for all the public methods. 
4. Refactor the classes according to SOLID principles.
